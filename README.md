# mjölnir
Mjölnir is a Python package to schedule, track and visualise workouts. It is currently under development. It is primarily developed for Jim Wendler's 531. However, Mjölnir is developed to be rather abstract, so any workout template should be applicable.

## an overview of planned features

- create workout templates with the CLI
- schedule workouts based on these workout templates with the CLI
- execute workouts with either CLI or a streamlit dashboard:
  - overview of all exercises; their sets, repetitions and even which plates to use
  - track sets by marking them as complete and/or filling in the attained number of repetitions
- insights module which allows the user to visualise their progress per exercise and see PRs
